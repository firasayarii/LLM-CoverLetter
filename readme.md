In this project, we used the LLAMA3 language model developed by Meta, integrated via GrockCloud, a cloud platform specialized in hosting and interacting with advanced LLM models. We also leveraged Langchain, a framework designed to build applications powered by language models, which simplifies integration with external data sources and handles complex query chains.

For job description extraction, we utilized web scraping through Langchain. The user can also input specific details they want to include for the job offer, and the system generates a complete motivation letter by simply entering the job URL and their custom additions.
